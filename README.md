# Machine Learning
 Machine learning rojects I did using python. In the projects reinforcement learning (Q-learning, monte carlo etc.) algorithms was used. 
 ## Blind Mouse Chasing Cheese
 A project where mouse needs to learn how to get to the cheese without any clues. He get rewarded when he reaches to the cheese and go back to his first place again. This process wil take place 100,000 times until mouse has enough experience to find the optimal solution.
